Reddit Enhancement Suite - github README

Hi there! Thanks for checking out RES on github.  A few important notes:

1) RES is GPLed, which means you're technically free to do whatever you wish in terms
of redistribution.  However, I ask out of courtesy that should you choose to release
your own, separate distribution of RES, you please name it something else completely.
Unfortunately, I have run into problems in the past with people redistributing under
the same name, and causing me tech support headaches.

2) Related: RES is not submitted to browser extension pages like the Chrome Extension
Gallery, AMO, etc, because the hope/intent is to provide simultaneous releases for all
four browsers at once - which is not possible given the variable approval times in each
gallery.  I ask that you please do not submit your own RES that isn't renamed there 
just to get browser syncing of extensions going - because like in #1, it has caused me
issues in the past.  Someone decided to submit to Chrome's gallery, then I was getting
tech support requests from people who were on an old (his) version and weren't getting
auto updated through my distribution channel.

I can't stop you from doing any of this. I'm just asking out of courtesy because I already
spend a great deal of time providing tech support and chasing down bugs, and it's much harder
when people think I'm the support guy for a separate branch of code.

Thanks!
